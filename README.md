# Mitochondrial Promoter Sequence Analysis

A structural analysis of mitochondrial DNA promoters.

We are developing a system and statistical framework for investigating the gene promoters of the mitochondrial genome. We will be focusing on classifying the structure and functional parts of the promoters. We can combine knowledge of bacterial promoters, and human transcription factors (and their binding profiles) with our own discovery and structural analysis of mitochondrial promoters. This will then be used to draw insights into mitochondrial transcriptional regulation. 

## Project Team
This project team was assembled through the Data Science Club at UCSB. The members of the team are as follows:
+ Shakuntala Mitra, a 4th year Biochemistry-Molecular Biology major at UCSB.
+ Ludvig Killinberg, a 1st year Computer Science Masters student at UCSB.
+ Maya Samet, a 4th year Statistics major at UCSB.
+ Zahra Afzal, a 3rd year Chemistry major at UCSB.

## Main Questions
+ What are commonly conserved features of the mitochondrial genome and its gene promoters?
+ How are mitochondrial gene promoters similar to bacterial gene promoters?
+ What are the functional parts of the mitochondrial promoters?
+ Which transcription factors bind to mitochondrial promoters and what do they have in common? What do their binding sequences (promoters) have in common? 
  + Are they nuclear or mitochondrial in origin?)
  + Does this change under cellular stress or during disease?
