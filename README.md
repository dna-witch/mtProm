# mtProm
A structural analysis of mitochondrial DNA promotors.

Based on what is known already about mitochondrial transcription factor binding profiles, we want to use that information. Also do discovery/structural analysis of mitochondrial promoters. Combine these two pieces of info to figure out if we can draw regulatory pathways for mitochondrial processes.
